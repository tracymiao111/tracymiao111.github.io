Hi! My name is Mingkai Miao (you could also call me Tracy), and I am excited to start my journey as an incoming PhD student in the Microelectronics Thrust at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Previously, I completed my Master's degree in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). If interested, you could find my resume [here](../assets/new_CV (1).pdf).
